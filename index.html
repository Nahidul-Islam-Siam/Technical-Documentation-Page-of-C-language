            <header>Variables and Data Types</header>
            <article>


                Certainly! Let's delve into the first important concept:

                <p>In C programming, a variable is a container for storing data. Each variable has a specific data type
                    that defines the kind of data it can hold. Here are key aspects related to variables and data types:
                </p>
                <p>Declaring Variables:</p>
                <code>// Syntax: data_type variable_name;
    int age;        // Declaration of an integer variable named 'age'
    float height;   // Declaration of a floating-point variable named 'height'
    char grade;     // Declaration of a character variable named 'grade'
</code>
                <p>Initializing Variables:</p>
                <code>age = 25;         // Initializing 'age' with the value 25
    height = 5.8;     // Initializing 'height' with the value 5.8
    grade = 'A';      // Initializing 'grade' with the character 'A'
    </code>
                <p>Common Data Types in C:</p>
                <li><b>int:</b> Integer data type for whole numbers.</li>
                <li><b>float:</b> Floating-point data type for numbers with decimal points.</li>
                <li><b>double:</b>Double-precision floating-point data type for more significant precision.</li>
                <li><b>char:</b> Character data type for single characters.</li>
                <li><b>_Bool:</b> Boolean data type for true/false values.</li>
                <p>Constants:
                </p>
                <code>const float PI = 3.14;   // Declaration and initialization of a constant
    </code>
                <p>Rules for Variable Naming:</p>
                <li>Variable names must start with a letter or underscore.</li>
                <li>Subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, or underscores.</li>
                <li>C is case-sensitive, so 'age' and 'Age' are different variables.</li>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <code>#include <stdio.h>

        int main() {
            // Variable declaration and initialization
            int num1 = 10;
            float num2 = 5.5;
        
            // Printing values
            printf("Value of num1: %d\n", num1);
            printf("Value of num2: %.2f\n", num2);
        
            return 0;
        }
        </code>
                <p>In this example, we declare and initialize two variables, num1 and num2, of types int and float,
                    respectively. We then print their values using printf. Understanding variables and data types is
                    foundational for any C programmer, as they form the building blocks for more complex programs.</p>

                <p>
                    Certainly! Let's delve into Operators in the context of C programming.
                </p>
                <p>Operators in C are symbols that represent computations or operations on variables and values. They
                    are fundamental for performing various tasks, from basic arithmetic calculations to more complex
                    logical operations. Here's an overview of the key types of operators in C:

                </p>
                <p>Arithmetic Operators</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>`+`</b><b>(Addition):</b><br>Adds two values.</li>
                    <li><b>`-`</b><b> (Subtraction):</b><br>Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.</li>
                    <li><b>`*`</b><b>(Multiplication):</b><br>Multiplies two values.</li>
                    <li><b>`/`</b><b> (Division):</b><br>Divides the left operand by the right operand.</li>
                    <li><b>`%`</b><b> (Modulus):</b><br>Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the
                        right operand.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Relational Operators:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>`==`</b><b> (Equal to):</b><br>Checks if two values are equal.</li>
                    <li><b>`!=`</b><b>(Not equal to):</b><br>Checks if two values are not equal.</li>
                    <li><b>`>`</b><b>(Greater than):</b><br>Checks if the left operand is greater than the right
                        operand.</li>
                    <li><b>`<`< /b><b> (Less than):</b><br>Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>`>=`</b><b>(Greater than or equal to):</b><br>Checks if the left operand is greater than or
                        equal to the right operand.</li>
                    <li><b>`<=`< /b><b> (Less than or equal to):</b><br>Checks if the left operand is less than or equal
                                to the right operand.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Logical Operators:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>`&&`</b><b> (Logical AND):</b><br>Returns true if both the left and right conditions are true
                    </li>
                    <li><b>`||`</b><b>(Logical OR):</b><br>Returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.</li>
                    <li><b>`!`</b><b> (Logical NOT):</b><br>Reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is
                        true, `!` makes it false, and vice versa.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Bitwise Operators:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>`&`</b><b> (Bitwise AND):</b><br>Performs a bitwise AND operation on each pair of
                        corresponding bits.</li>
                    <li><b>`|`</b><b>(Bitwise OR):</b><br>Performs a bitwise OR operation on each pair of corresponding
                        bits.</li>
                    <li><b>`^`</b><b>(Bitwise XOR):</b><br>Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair
                        of corresponding bits.</li>
                    <li><b>`~`</b><b> (Bitwise NOT):</b><br>Flips the bits of its operand. 0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0.
                    </li>

                </ol>
                <p>Assignment Operators:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>`=`</b><b>(Assignment):</b><br>Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>`+=`,`-=`,`*=`,`%=`</b><b> (Compound Assignment):</b><br>Performs an operation and assigns
                        the result to the variable.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These operators are crucial for manipulating variables and controlling the flow of your program. A
                    solid understanding of operators is essential for writing efficient and expressive C code.</p>

            <article>
                <p>If Statement:</p>
                <p>The `if ` statement is used for conditional execution of code. It allows you to specify a block of
                    code to be executed if a given condition is true.</p>
                <code>if (condition) {
        // Code to execute if the condition is true
    } else {
        // Code to execute if the condition is false
    }
    </code>
                <p>Switch-Case Statement:</p>
                <p>The `switch` statement is used for multi-way branching. It allows you to choose from several
                    different alternatives based on the value of an expression.</p>
                <code>switch (expression) {
        case value1:
            // Code to execute if expression matches value1
            break;
        case value2:
            // Code to execute if expression matches value2
            break;
        // ... other cases
        default:
            // Code to execute if none of the cases match
    }
    </code>
                <p>Loops:</p>
                <p>Loops in C allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are three main types of loops:</p>
                <li><b>For Loop:</b></li>
                <code>for (initialization; condition; update) {
        // Code to execute repeatedly
    }
    </code>
                <li><b>While Loop:</b></li>
                <code>while (condition) {
        // Code to execute repeatedly as long as the condition is true
    }
    </code>
                <li><b>Do-While Loop:</b></li>
                <code>do {
        // Code to execute repeatedly
    } while (condition);
    </code>
                <p>In a loop, the `condition` is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop
                    body is executed; otherwise, the loop terminates.</p>
                <p>Examples</p>
                <li><b>If Statement Example:</b></li>
                <code>int num = 10;

    if (num > 0) {
        printf("The number is positive.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The number is non-positive.\n");
    }
    </code>
                <li><b>Switch-Case Example:</b></li>
                <code>int day = 3;

        switch (day) {
            case 1:
                printf("Sunday\n");
                break;
            case 2:
                printf("Monday\n");
                break;
            // ... other cases
            default:
                printf("Invalid day\n");
        }
        </code>
                <li><b>For Loop Example:</b></li>
                <code>for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
        }
        </code>
                <li><b>While Loop Example:</b></li>
                <code>int count = 0;

            while (count < 3) {
                printf("Count: %d\n", count);
                count++;
            }
            </code>
                <li><b>Do-While Loop Example:</b></li>
                <code>int x = 5;

        do {
            printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);
            x--;
        } while (x > 0);
        </code>
                <p>Understanding and effectively using control structures is essential for writing structured,
                    efficient, and logically sound C programs. They provide the means to make decisions and control the
                    flow of your program based on certain conditions.</p>

            <article>
                <p>In C programming, a function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task.
                    Functions are essential for breaking down a program into smaller, manageable pieces, promoting code
                    organization, reusability, and maintainability. Here are key aspects to know about functions in C:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Declaration and Definitio</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Declaration:</b>Before using a function, you need to declare it. A function declaration
                            tells the compiler about the function's name, return type, and the types of its parameters.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Definition:</b>The definition provides the actual implementation of the function,
                            including the code block inside curly braces `{}`.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <code>// Function declaration
                    int add(int a, int b);
                    
                    // Function definition
                    int add(int a, int b) {
                        return a + b;
                    }
                    </code>
                    <li>Function Prototypes:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A function prototype is a declaration that provides information about the function's name,
                            return type, and parameter types. It acts as a "promise" to the compiler that the function
                            will be defined later in the code.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <code>// Function prototype
                        int add(int a, int b);
                        </code>
                    <li>
                        Return Type:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Functions can have a return type, indicating the type of value the function will return
                            after execution. If a function does not return any value, the return type is specified as
                            `void`.</li>


                    </ul>
                    <code>// Function returning an integer
                            int add(int a, int b) {
                                return a + b;
                            }
                            
                            // Function with no return value
                            void greet() {
                                printf("Hello, World!\n");
                            }
                            </code>
                    <li>Parameters:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Functions can take parameters (inputs) that influence their behavior. Parameters are
                            specified in the function declaration and definition. They act as variables within the
                            function, taking on the values passed during the function call.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <code>// Function with parameters
                                int multiply(int x, int y) {
                                    return x * y;
                                }
                                
                                // Function call with arguments
                                int result = multiply(5, 3);
                                </code>
                    <li>Function Call:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                To use a function, you "call" it by its name, providing the required arguments if any.
                                The function executes, and its return value (if any) can be assigned to a variable or
                                used directly.
                            </li>

                                Variables declared within a function have local scope, meaning they are only accessible
                                within that function. Parameters and local variables are typically used to store and
                                manipulate data within the function.
                            </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                C supports recursive functions, where a function calls itself. Understanding recursion
                                is crucial for solving problems that can be naturally expressed using a recursive
                                approach.
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                        <code>int factorial(int n) {
                                        if (n == 0 || n == 1)
                                            return 1;
                                        else
                                            return n * factorial(n - 1);
                                    }
                                    </code>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Understanding functions is fundamental to writing structured and modular code in C. Functions enable
                    code reuse, enhance readability, and simplify the development and maintenance of software projects.

                <h2>Strings:</h2>
                <p>In C, a string is represented as an array of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`).
                    Strings are essential for handling text and character data. Key points about strings in C include:
                </p>
                <li><b>Declaration and Initialization:</b></li>
                <code>char greeting[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
            char message[] = "Welcome"; // Declaration and initialization as a string literal
            </code>
                <li><b>String Input/Output:</b></li>
                <code>printf("%s\n", message); // Printing a string
                scanf("%s", greeting); // Reading a string from user input
                </code>
                <li><b>String Functions:</b>
                    C provides several standard library functions for string manipulation, such as `strlen()`,
                    `strcpy()`, `strcat()`, and `strcmp()`</li>
                <code>#include <string.h>

                        int length = strlen(message);
                        char destination[20];
                        strcpy(destination, message); // Copying one string to another
                        strcat(destination, " to C"); // Concatenating strings
                        </code>
                <p>Understanding arrays and strings is crucial as they are fundamental data structures used in a wide
                    range of C programming tasks, from simple list-like structures to complex text processing and
                    manipulation. Proper usage and manipulation of arrays and strings contribute to writing efficient
                    and robust C programs.</p>

            <header>Pointers and Memory Management</header>
            <article>
                <h2>Pointers:</h2>
                <li><b>Definition:</b><br>In C, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another
                    variable. It allows direct manipulation of memory, enabling efficient data handling and dynamic
                    memory allocation.</li>
                <li><b>Declaration:</b><br>To declare a pointer, you specify the data type it points to, followed by an
                    asterisk (*) and the pointer's name. For example:</li>
                <code>int *ptr;
</code>
                <li><b>Initialization:</b><br>Pointers are initialized with the address of a variable:</li>
                <code>int x = 10;
    int *ptr = &x; // ptr now holds the address of x
    </code>
                <li><b>Dereferencing:</b><br>To access the value stored at the memory location pointed to by a pointer,
                    you use the dereference operator (*):
                </li>
                <code>int value = *ptr; // value now holds the value of x
    </code>
                <h2>Memory Management:</h2>
                <li><b>Dynamic Memory Allocation:</b><br>C provides functions like `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`,
                    and `free()` for dynamic memory allocation. This allows you to allocate memory at runtime and manage
                    it manually.</li>
                <code>int *arr = (int*)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // Allocates memory for an array of 5 integers
    </code>
                <li><b>Deallocation:</b><br>Memory allocated with malloc() or related functions should be released using
                    free() to avoid memory leaks:</li>
                <code>free(arr); // Releases the memory allocated for the array
    </code>
                <li><b>Pointer Arithmetic:</b><br>Pointers can be incremented or decremented to navigate through memory
                    locations. Pointer arithmetic is based on the size of the data type the pointer points to</li>
                <code>int *ptr = arr;
        ptr++; // Moves to the next integer in the array
        </code>
                <li><b>Null Pointers:</b><br>A pointer can be assigned a special value called NULL to indicate that it
                    doesn't point to any valid memory location.</li>
                <code>int *ptr = NULL;
</code>
                <li><b>Memory Leaks:</b><br>Failing to deallocate memory can lead to memory leaks, where the program
                    retains memory that is no longer needed. Proper memory management is crucial to prevent such issues.
                </li>
                <p>Understanding pointers and memory management is essential for efficient and error-free C programming.
                    It enables dynamic data structures, efficient algorithms, and precise control over memory resources.
                    However, it also requires careful handling to avoid common pitfalls like dangling pointers and
                    memory leaks.</p>

            <header>Structures and Unions in C</header>

            <article>
                <p>Structures:</p>
                <p><b>Definition:</b></p>
                <p>A structure in C is a composite data type that allows you to group variables of different data types
                    under a single name. Each variable in a structure is called a member or field.</p>
                <p><b>Declaration:</b></p>
                <code>struct Person {
        char name[50];
        int age;
        float salary;
    };
    </code>
                <p><b>Usage:</b></p>
                <code>struct Person employee1;

        // Accessing members
        strcpy(employee1.name, "John Doe");
        employee1.age = 30;
        employee1.salary = 50000.0;
        </code>
                <p>In this example, `Person` is a structure with three members: `name` (a character array), `age` (an
                    integer), and `salary` (a floating-point number). You can create variables of type `struct Person`
                    to store information about individuals.</p>
                <p>Unions:</p>
                <p><b>Definition:</b></p>
                <p>A union, like a structure, is a composite data type that allows you to group variables of different
                    data types under a single name. However, in a union, all members share the same memory location, and
                    only one member can have a value at a time.

                </p>
                <p><b>Declaration:</b></p>
                <code>union Data {
            int i;
            float f;
            char str[20];
        };
        </code>
                <p><b>union Data data1;

                        // Accessing members
                        data1.i = 10;
                        printf("Integer: %d\n", data1.i);

                        data1.f = 3.14;
                        printf("Float: %f\n", data1.f);

                        strcpy(data1.str, "Hello");
                        printf("String: %s\n", data1.str);
                    </b></p>
                <code>union Data data1;

                // Accessing members
                data1.i = 10;
                printf("Integer: %d\n", data1.i);
                
                data1.f = 3.14;
                printf("Float: %f\n", data1.f);
                
                strcpy(data1.str, "Hello");
                printf("String: %s\n", data1.str);
                </code>
                <p>In this example, `Data` is a union with three members: `i` (integer), `f` (float), and `str`
                    (character array). You can only use one member at a time. When you assign a value to one member, the
                    other members may contain garbage values.</p>
                <p>Use Cases:</p>
                <li><b>Structures:</b><br>Structures are useful when you need to group related data with different data
                    types. For example, a structure can represent a person with attributes like name, age, and salary.
                </li>
                <li><b>Unions:</b><br>Unions are handy when you want to store different types of data in the same memory
                    location. For example, a union can be used to represent a variable that can be an integer, a float,
                    or a string at different times.</li>
                <code>#include <stdio.h>
                    #include <string.h>
                    
                    // Structure definition
                    struct Person {
                        char name[50];
                        int age;
                        float salary;
                    };
                    
                    // Union definition
                    union Data {
                        int i;
                        float f;
                        char str[20];
                    };
                    
                    int main() {
                        // Using a structure
                        struct Person employee1;
                        strcpy(employee1.name, "John Doe");
                        employee1.age = 30;
                        employee1.salary = 50000.0;
                    
                        printf("Employee Name: %s\n", employee1.name);
                        printf("Age: %d\n", employee1.age);
                        printf("Salary: $%.2f\n", employee1.salary);
                    
                        // Using a union
                        union Data data1;
                        data1.i = 10;
                        printf("Integer: %d\n", data1.i);
                    
                        data1.f = 3.14;
                        printf("Float: %f\n", data1.f);
                    
                        strcpy(data1.str, "Hello");
                        printf("String: %s\n", data1.str);
                    
                        return 0;
                    }
                    </code>
                <p>In this example, we define a structure `Person` to represent an employee and a union `Data` to store
                    different types of data. The `main` function demonstrates how to use both structures and unions.</p>

                <header>Dynamic Memory Allocation</header>
                <p>In C, dynamic memory allocation allows you to manage memory at runtime, providing flexibility in
                    handling variable-sized data structures. Unlike static memory allocation, where memory is allocated
                    during compilation, dynamic allocation is done during program execution.
